# Password protection

It is forbidden to use the same password for the company's user accounts as for other information systems (for example, home Internet service provider, free e-mail, forums, etc.). If possible, do not use the same password for different corporate systems. You should also use different passwords on different services.
It is forbidden to disclose the password to anyone, including administrative staff. All passwords are your confidential information.

The list of prohibited actions with passwords:
- do not tell anyone the password on the phone;
- do not specify a password in e-mail messages;
- do not tell the password to your management staff;
- do not communicate the principles of creating a password (for example, " based on my last name");
- do not give out your password in e-polls and unfamiliar forms of authorization;
- do not give the password to family members and relatives;
- do not pass the password to colleagues during your vacation.

Using a unique password for every system and service is a good idea. You can use a company specified password storage for convenience (like Passbolt).

Using ssh keys can help you ease the use of passwords, so you don't have to enter your pasword all the time.
