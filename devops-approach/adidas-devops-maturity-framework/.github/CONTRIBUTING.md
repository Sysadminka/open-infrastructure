# Contributing
First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

To contribute to a adidas DevOps Maturity Framework simply fork the repository, commit and push the changes and open a pull request. 

## Review
Note, however, that adidas DevOps Maturity Framework are followed by architects and engineers at adidas and as such any **pull request needs to be reviewed and approved by adidas team**.

Some changes like typos, clarifications and examples can be approved relatively quick, however substantial changes, changes to the rules or addition of new rules are subject of a thorough review and approval process lead by the adidas team.
