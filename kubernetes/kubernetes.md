# I recommend using kubespray for kubernetes deployments: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray
# Use a stable branch, deploy cluster with kubeadm, scale cluster with kubespray/ansible or directly with kubeadm.
# Alternative: https://github.com/centosadmin/kubespray - southbridge.io fork for kubespray, maintains traditional cluster deploy without kubeadm, is more stable.
